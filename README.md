# WeatherAPI
When making this project, California was going through a series of deadly wild fires which inspired me to combine my interest of coding with the recent natural disaster. 

To create the project, I used the Open Weather Map API and learned how to manage Maven Dependencies for Java Projects.

Since I am familiar with Python, I also used this project to learn Java so I can learn more about multi-class project structures and better contribute to my FIRST Tech Challenge robotics team.
