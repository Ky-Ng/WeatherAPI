# WeatherAPI
I was always facinated about how data can be pulled from straight from the internet and be parsed in a JSON format! When making this project, California was going through a series of deadly wild fires which inspired me to combine my interest of coding with the recent natural disaster.

Since I am familiar with Python, I also used this project to learn Java so I can learn more about multi-class project structures and better contribute to my FIRST Tech Challenge robotics team.
